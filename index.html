        <p>Pond's Cream was invented in the United States as a patent medicine by pharmacist Theron T. Pond (1800â€“1852) of Utica, New York, in 1846. Mr. Pond extracted a healing tea from witch hazel [Hamamelis spp.] which he discovered could heal small cuts and other ailments. The product was named "Golden Treasure." After Theron died, it would soon be known as "Pond's Extract."In 1849, the T. T. Pond Company was formed with Pond and other investors.</p>
